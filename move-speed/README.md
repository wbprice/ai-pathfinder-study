# All Paths

## Task
Given that 
- a tank exists on a Cartesian grid at [0, 0] 
- a moving on the x-axis and y-axis is half as expensive

List all the paths that it could take using 2 steps 

## Rules
- The tank can only move twice
- The tank's path cannot loop back on itself (it can't return to where it started)
